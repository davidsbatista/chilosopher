				<p>Most of these songs were just guitar jams, riffs and chord progressions which I had already had in my mind for a while, and others that I just recorded spontaneously. 
					They were very unprofessional recorded, some including background noise but I like them like that, it was my first recording experiment.</p>

				<p>This simple song resulted from visiting a friend, Lu√≠s. He built its own studio at home and while he was showing me the guitars and the recording apparatus and machinery I started playing some guitar riffs, 
					  and he started recording just for fun, after a while he decided to take it further.</p>
				<p>So, we ended up recording drums, and bass guitar and after he happily mixed it, and the result is this happy short song.</p>
