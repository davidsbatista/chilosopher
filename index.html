				<p>Most of these songs were just guitar jams, riffs and chord progressions which I had already had in my mind for a while, and others that I just recorded spontaneously. 
					They were very unprofessional recorded, some including background noise but I like them like that, it was my first recording experiment.</p>
				<p>"The Beginning" - something that came up, spontaneously, one of the riffs I already had in my head, the melody on top was recorded on the fly.</p>
				<p>"Water" - the chord progression I already had on my mind for a while, just slow it down, and the melody was improvised and recorded on-the-fly.</p>
				<p>"Balance" - balancing between over-creating and enjoying the simplicity of things, and getting hooked on a very cool "too-much-delay-and-flanger" effect.</p>

				<p>This simple song resulted from visiting a friend, Lu√≠s.</p>
				<p>He built its own studio at home and while he was showing me the guitars and the recording apparatus and machinery I started playing some guitar riffs, 
					  and he started recording just for fun, after a while he decided to take it further.</p>
				<p>So, we ended up recording drums, and bass guitar and after he happily mixed it, and the result is this happy short song.</p>
